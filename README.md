## About Me

I'm a software engineering leader who loves wearing many hatsâ€”from engineering management and solution architecture to project management and technical sales, even getting my hands dirty with some coding. Iâ€™ve built scalable, distributed systems that align perfectly with business goals. Big fan of Agile and Lean, Iâ€™m all about modern software architectures, product development, and DevOps. Iâ€™m passionate about mentoring and building high-performing teams, fostering a culture that balances technical excellence with continuous improvement. Known for blending business needs with technical solutions, I make sure things get done across teams and platforms.
